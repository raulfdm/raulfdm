# Hello/Hola/Olá! I'm Raul 👋

Born in the lands of Brazil, making a home in Spain.

Here are a few things you should know about me:

- memes and Non-sense humor 🤡 give me life!
- I'm a fervent admirer of all forms of art 🎨
- I enjoy capturing moments 📸;
- Traveling and exploring new cultures 🧳 fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspective.
- When it comes to games 🎮, I'm an all-rounder. No allegiance to a single platform here!
- I find joy in the rhythm of dance 🕺
-  My dedication extends to fitness 🏋️‍♂️ as well. A healthy body fosters a healthy mind.
- I have a knack for nifty gadgets 🔮, regardless of their (lack of) practicality.

Oh, and did I mention my affinity for problem-solving? It's not just limited to humans, but extends to machines as well. Teaching both people 👨🏽‍🏫 (in human language) and machines 👨🏽‍💻 (in programming language) is a passion of mine.
