# Hallo! 👋

I'm Raul.

Here are some things I like:

- lists 📃
- memes 😹
- art 🎨
- photography 📸
- playing games 🎮 (not a platform fanboy)
- dancing 🕺
- working out 🏋️‍♂️
- ~~useless~~ gadgets 🔮

Ah... almost forgot. I'm also into teaching both people 👨‍🏫 (human language) and machines 👨‍💻 (programing language) how to **solve problems**.

## Find me

I'm not a social media addict person but you can find me on:

- [My Website](raulmelo.dev/) - This is my lab where I test things and write blog posts about what I think and how I fell.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raul_fdm) - warning: It isn't technical twitter. I shared programming stuff but also politicals and humor! :)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/raul_fdm/) - Where I post photos I'm very proud to take.
- [Curriculum](raulmelo.dev/cv) - Where you can find my skills and experience
